            <h2>Happy Birthday to the love of my life, my heart’s greatest treasure. ❤️</h2>
            <p>
                Today, the universe celebrates you, and so do I—with all my heart, my soul, and every ounce of love I have. You are the reason the world feels more beautiful, the reason my days are filled with joy, and the reason my heart knows what true love feels like.

On this special day, I want you to know that you are my everything—my dream come true, my perfect wish, and my forever. You deserve a birthday as magical as your smile, as warm as your hugs, and as breathtaking as the love you’ve given me.

I can’t wait to spend every moment making you feel adored, spoiled, and as special as you truly are. Today is yours, my love, but know that you will always have me—forever and beyond.

Happy Birthday, my one and only. You are my forever and always. 🌹💫
